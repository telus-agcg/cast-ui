# Cast UI

Cast UI is an open source component library maintained by [TKXS](https://www.tkxs.com/)

A `defaultTheme` theme is available, which can be overridden by passing
in a theme of the same shape into the `ThemeProvider`.
Components receive this theme if no other theme is provided.

To import Themes

```js
import { Themes } from '@tkxs/cast-ui';
```

The ThemeProvider is passed on from styled-components and will provide
the child components with the Theme object as a prop.

```js
import { Themes, ThemeProvider } from '@tkxs/cast-ui';

<ThemeProvider theme={Themes.defaultTheme}>
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>;
```

### The shape of the theme object.

<Source language="json" code={JSON.stringify(Themes.defaultTheme, null, 2)} />
